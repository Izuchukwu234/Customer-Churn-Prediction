# Customer Churn Prediction
A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that I am an analyst at this company and I have to find out who is leaving and why.

I am going to use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and it will make me uncover insights one can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company. 

This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help me to retain customers. Well, I can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

*   Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
*   Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
*   Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
*   Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
